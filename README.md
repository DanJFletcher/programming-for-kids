A while back, a read an [article](https://medium.com/vehikl-news/10-ways-to-teach-kids-to-code-1c5e4b68a247) exploring various ways to teach young children how to program.

One method was by playing a simple game, where you had cards with instructions like "walk forward" or "turn left" printed on them. Your child chooses instructions from the cards, and you act out the execution.

My wife and I played this game with our 3 old and had a blast! So I decided it might be neat to make him a version of that game on the web where he can play using a phone, tablet or anyother touch screen device.

I'm very new to React but decided to use the library for this project. I like the component based approach and thought this would be a nice opportunity to explore it.
